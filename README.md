# :arrow_up: updoot
Updoot is a simple game written with Rust and [Yew 0.19](https://yew.rs/).

#### How to Play
Updoot grabs recent comments from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). The player is shown a parent comment, and then 2 child comments.

One of the child comments is real, and the other is generated by [OpenAI's GPT-3 autoregressive language model API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/). It's your job as the player to beat the machine and choose the fake response.

Note: This is one of my first Rust projects, so the code can be somewhat abysmal as I still grasp Rustic-centric language features like ownership and borrowing. If you're reading this and learn something, then great! But don't expect to find many best practices creeping around this codebase.

### Deprecate Code Sections

A tool which scrapes a shortlist of the most recent submissions from <a href="https://lobste.rs/">lobste.rs</a>, then uses the submission data to generate a shortened user tree.
Uses [id-tree](https://github.com/iwburns/id-tree) and [id-tree-layout](https://github.com/jsinger67/id-tree-layout) for SVG generation.

**:warning: Note:** There is no publicly available lobste.rs API for a purpose like this, so making even a limited number of requests comes with some difficulties. If you're adapting any code in this repository to do something similar, I don't recommend doing it this way.
